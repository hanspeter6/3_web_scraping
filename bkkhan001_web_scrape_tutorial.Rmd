#### Web Scraping Project

In this project basic run of paper (ROP) rates will be "scraped" from the Cape Town newspaper *Die Burger*'s website.

Using *SelectorGadget* resulted in identifying and therefore extracting information that was not being targeted. Since they were in drop-down pages, it was not possible to deselect them. Furthermore, although the target appeared to be a table, the *html_table* function did not work in this example. Accordingly the file was treated as text, creating some additional challenges.

From the scraped text information, the target lines needed to be identified and extracted, placed into a data frame and formatted correctly for further processing.

The final outcome succeeds in showing what was intended.

The URL of the targeted web page is: http://www.ads24.co.za/misc/publication?brand=die-burger&key=5E33675F402BBEECE647DF3FF47C2C51#key

```{r}
# identify target website & create R-object of the html file & look at it
site <- "http://www.ads24.co.za/misc/publication?brand=die-burger&key=5E33675F402BBEECE647DF3FF47C2C51#rates"

# reading in the html file
burger_html <- read_html(site)
burger_html
```

```{r}
# getting elements, trimming & look at it
burger_elements <- html_nodes(burger_html, css = "td , td, th")

burger_text <- html_text(burger_elements, trim = TRUE) 
as.tibble(burger_text[20:30]) # sample
```

```{r}
# cleaning up the dataframe
# 
# get rid of first lines & define variable names
rops <- burger_text[3:47]
names <- rops[1:5]

# turn content into a data frame and name the columns
df <- as.data.frame(matrix(rops[6:45], ncol = 5, nrow = 8, byrow = TRUE))
names(df) <- names

# turn the numeric vars into such
library(stringr)
df$BW <- as.numeric(str_extract(as.character(df$BW), "[^R]\\d+"))
df$FC <- as.numeric(str_extract(as.character(df$FC), "[^R]\\d+"))

# look at it
df
```
